# Calculator_js
## Description
A calculator side project that was developed in order to fufilt the requirments to pass a course. A web-version built using html, css and javascript.
For whatever reason, i decided to make my life harder by refusing to use js eval function and other built in functions that would have made this alot.. like alot easier
